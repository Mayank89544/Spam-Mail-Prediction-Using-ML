# Spam Mail Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict whether an email is spam or not using a machine learning model.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The email content is vectorized using the `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to convert text into numerical feature vectors.
- **Model**: A logistic regression model (or whichever algorithm you used) is trained on the dataset.
- **Prediction**: The trained model predicts whether an email is spam based on its content.
